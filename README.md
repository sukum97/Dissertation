Intrusion Detection System Using AI/ML Algorithms to tackle various security attacks in Vehicular networks
Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) have emerged as a promising technology for improving
road safety, traffic efficiency, and driver comfort. However, the security of VANETs is a critical
issue, as the communication between vehicles and infrastructure is vulnerable to a range of
security attacks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have become a fundamental tool for ensuring
the security of VANETs. Machine Learning (ML) has been widely used in IDSs for VANETs to detect
various security attacks, such as Denial-of-Service (DoS), Sybil, and Malware attacks. This paper
presents a comprehensive review of VANET security, wide range of attacks on VANET and IDSs
used for detecting them, as well as the applications of ML algorithm like Random Forest and
XGBoost in IDS alongside feature selection methods like CFS (Correlation-based Feature
Selection) and SFS (Sequential Feature Selection).. We evaluate the performance of Random
Forest and XGBBoost to detect and stop the attacks on the datasets and we will compute the
accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score and we compare with the different algorithms like
Decision Tree Classifier and KNN and find their effectiveness. The challenges that need to be
addressed to improve the security of VANETs.To make it more secure, efficient, and reliable.
